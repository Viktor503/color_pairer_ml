# color_pairer_ml
This project can help you pair color with the help of neural networks

When you run main.py this will happen
First you will have to choose wether you like a color pairing or not (I recommend doing about 50 of these)

Then you can close the gui window, and the code will start to calculate the optimal weights for your preferences
After that is done a you can close the graph, and play around with the rgb sliders to see what the code recommends, enjoy. :)
